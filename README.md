Demonstrate knowledge on how to design and use an API specified as:
1) A concrete class,
2) an abstract class,
3) an interface

You MUST implement THREE APIs 
and THREE set of derived classes from those THREE APIs (9 derived classes)
AND you will need to demonstrate the use of EACH of the THREE APIs with it's derived objects in a Zoo class.
(ZooAnimals, ZooAbstractAnimals, ZooAnamalisticAnimals)

Design an API (e.g. AnimalAPI for using derived classes)
1. Use a concrete class as API (AnimalAPI);
2. Use an Abstract class as API (AbstractAnimalAPI):
3. Use an Interface class as API (AnimalisticAPI):

Create THREE zoo classes, each for holding and showing animal objects state USING an overloaded toString() method:
1. ZooAnimals: For holding and showing animal objects derived from AnimalAPI (ZooAnimalAPI):
2. ZooAbstractAnimals: For holding and showing animal objects derived from AbstractAnimalAPI (ZooAbstractAnimalAPI):
3. ZooAnamalisticAnimals: For holding and showing animal objects derived from AnimalisticAPI (ZooAnimalisticAPI):
